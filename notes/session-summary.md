- Refined copy to highlight storytelling focus, updated skills taxonomy, and enhanced project/experience descriptions.
- Added responsive navigation with theme toggle, icon-driven contact buttons, and light/dark palettes.
- Refreshed visuals: new gradients, card styling, icon sets, and swapped project artwork to WebP assets.
