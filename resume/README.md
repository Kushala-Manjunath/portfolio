# Resume Workflow

1. Update `resume.tex` with your latest experience, metrics, and links.
2. Compile to PDF with a LaTeX distribution (TexLive or MiKTeX):
   ```bash
   pdflatex resume.tex
   ```
3. Move the generated `resume.pdf` into `../portfolio/assets/resume/` so the site links serve the latest version.
4. Commit both `resume.tex` and the PDF for version history alongside the portfolio.
